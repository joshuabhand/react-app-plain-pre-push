This project demonstrates a simple pre-push hook. No additional modules required.

PROS
- Very little change to project structure, dependency or otherwise

CONS
- The pre-push hook file resides in the .git directory which does not get pushed to repo; We must manually add this to our local repo.

## The Gist of this approach

Git hooks and scripts are described in pre-push hook.

## Install hook

1) Navigate to .git/hooks and rename "pre-push.sample" to "pre-push"
2) Replace contents of file with below script:

```
#!/bin/sh
grep \(delete\)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
# Do not run tests if deleting remote branch
exit 0
else
npm run lint && npm run test
fi
```

## More Info

"The hooks are all stored in the hooks subdirectory of the Git directory. In most projects, thatâ€™s .git/hooks. When you initialize a new repository with git init, Git populates the hooks directory with a bunch of example scripts..."
